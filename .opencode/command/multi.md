  Run two or more agents in parallel on the same task and synthesise
  their results. Mention agents by @name in your message.
  Example: /multi @researcher @cloud-reviewer analyse the FFT pipeline
subtask: false

You are coordinating a parallel agent run for the Mimir project.

Spawn each @mentioned agent simultaneously as independent subagents,
giving each the same task described in this message. Do not start one
and wait for it to finish before starting the next — launch all of them
at the same time.

Wait until all subagents have reported back, then synthesise their
findings into a single coherent response. Highlight where agents agreed,
where they disagreed, and which recommendation to act on.

Do not write or modify any files until synthesis is complete and the
user has confirmed the direction.
